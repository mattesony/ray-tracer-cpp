Build the program with "qmake" and "make", then run with "./OpenGLAssignment" (or just open the .pro project file in Qt Creator with Qt 5.9.2 and run there - I've included a prebuilt executable too, in case there is some issue).

Specify the data file in the text box to the left of the load button. The path of the file is relative to where the executable is. I have my data file one directory above where the execuatble is built to, so there is a "../" that might need to be deleted.

Once the polygons have loaded, a menu will be enabled for performing transformations, switching between axonometric projections, and enabling or disabling clipping once a point of an object exits the unit cube. To perform a transformation, enter to object ID it transform in the menu box, then use the transformation menues. Click the save button to save any changes to the data file entered.
